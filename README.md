# Techdegree-Project-1
My first techdegree project
The goal of this first project is to create an app that displays random famous quotes, each time a button is clicked.
FOR EXTRA CREDIT:
I added a property of 'tags' to some of the objects.
Created a function to change the background color of the page each time a new quote is displayed.
Added a timer function to auto-refresh the quotes every 5 seconds.
